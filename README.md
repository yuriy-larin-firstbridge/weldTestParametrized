# weldTestParametrized

The project is created as minimal example to show the problem using Weld junit5 library with **@ParameterizedTest** junit5 annotation.

Run ServiceExampleTest and see failed doesntWork() test.

In order to fix it you should use **@ExplicitParamInjection** annotation on test class.
